            <!-- Overview -->
            <h2>What's This All About?</h2>
            <p>
                So here's the deal: I needed to redesign a heat exchanger that wasn't cutting it anymore.
                The goal? Make it transfer heat way better, reduce pressure drop (because pumps are expensive to run),
                and do all this without making it bigger. Oh, and it had to actually be possible to manufacture.
                No problem, right? 😅
            </p>

            <!-- Problem Statement -->
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                The old heat exchanger was basically slacking off on the job. It wasn't moving heat efficiently,
                which meant higher energy bills and unhappy stakeholders. Here's what I needed to achieve:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Boost heat transfer by at least 25% (without making it bigger - space is limited!)</li>
                <li>Cut pressure drop by 15% or more (less pumping power = lower electricity bills)</li>
                <li>Play nice with the existing system (can't change all the mounting points and pipes)</li>
                <li>Keep it affordable with materials that can handle 0-150°C</li>
                <li>Make sure it can actually be manufactured without needing magic or a PhD</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Design Process -->
            <h2>Design & Development Process</h2>

            <h3>1. Research & Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                First things first: I dove into the research. Looked at plate-fin, shell-and-tube, and
                microchannel designs. Fired up MATLAB to crunch some numbers and figure out what configuration
                would actually work. Turns out, plate-fin was the winner for this application.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Concept Development</h3>
            <p>
                Next, I played around with three different fin geometries: offset strip fins, louvered fins,
                and wavy fins. After some CFD analysis (which took way longer than I'd like to admit), the
                offset strip fins came out on top. Best heat transfer without destroying the pressure drop.
                Science for the win! 🔬
            </p>

            <h3>3. Detailed Design</h3>
            <p>
                Time to get into the nitty-gritty details:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Built a parametric CAD model in SolidWorks (parametric = easy to tweak when things don't work)</li>
                <li>Went with Aluminum 6061-T6 - good thermal conductivity, won't corrode, and won't break the bank</li>
                <li>Nailed down the fin geometry: 3.2 mm pitch, 8.5 mm height, 0.3 mm thick</li>
                <li>Ran a bunch of CFD simulations to optimize the channel dimensions</li>
                <li>Made sure everything was manufacturable (ASME standards and all that)</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Analysis & Testing -->
            <h2>Analysis & Validation</h2>

            <h3>Simulation & Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Time to put it to the test (virtually, at least) with ANSYS Fluent:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ran full 3D conjugate heat transfer simulations (fancy way of saying "I simulated everything")</li>
                <li>Test conditions: 120°C hot side, 20°C cold side, 2.5 L/s flow rate</li>
                <li>Did a mesh refinement study to make sure the results were legit (ended up with 3.2M cells)</li>
                <li>The results? 32% better heat transfer! 🎉 (Target was 25%, so I'll take it)</li>
                <li>Bonus: pressure drop went down by 18% (beat the 15% target too!)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Testing & Validation</h3>
            <p>
                Simulations are great, but nothing beats real-world testing. Built a prototype and put it through its paces:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tested it across the full operating range (because edge cases matter)</li>
                <li>Measured heat transfer was within 5% of what the CFD predicted (pretty darn close!)</li>
                <li>Pressure drop measurements? Within 7% of simulations. Nailed it. ✓</li>
                <li>Ran it for 1000+ hours straight - no issues, no degradation. This thing's a tank.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Results -->
            <h2>The Results</h2>
            <p>
                Mission accomplished! Here's how it turned out:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ 32% boost in heat transfer (crushed the 25% target)</li>
                <li>✅ 18% reduction in pressure drop (beat the 15% goal)</li>
                <li>✅ Same size as the old one (space saved = money saved)</li>
                <li>✅ Only 8% more expensive to make, but saves about $12k/year in energy costs (ROI in like 2 months!)</li>
                <li>✅ Dropped right into the existing system with zero drama</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                <strong>Bottom line:</strong> The new design works better, costs less to run, and fits in the same space.
                That's what I call a successful redesign! 🚀
            </p>

            <!-- Key Learnings -->
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                Every project teaches you something new. Here's what this one taught me:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>CFD is powerful, but you HAVE to validate with real tests (simulations can lie)</li>
                <li>Parametric CAD modeling saves so much time when you're iterating designs</li>
                <li>Always design with manufacturing in mind - the coolest design is useless if you can't build it</li>
                <li>Sometimes the "optimal" solution isn't practical. Balance is key.</li>
                <li>Document everything as you go. Future you will thank present you.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Future Work -->
            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            <p>
                This design works great, but there's always room for improvement:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Could try topology optimization to squeeze out even more performance</li>
                <li>Surface coatings might boost heat transfer even more (worth exploring)</li>
                <li>Add some sensors and make it "smart" with predictive maintenance</li>
                <li>Variable flow control could adapt to different load conditions automatically</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                But for now, this design is doing its job and doing it well. Sometimes "done and working" beats "perfect." 😎
