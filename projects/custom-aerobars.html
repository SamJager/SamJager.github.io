            <!-- Overview -->
            <h2>What's This All About?</h2>
            <p>
                As both an engineer and a triathlete, I wasn't happy with the aerobar options on the market.
                Commercial options either cost a fortune or use small pads that aren't very comfortable. Inspired by custom 
                setups with full arm coverage like the ones used by Magnus Ditlev and other pro triathletes, I decided to 
                create a solution specific to my position, bike, and components.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal was simple: create custom aerobars that fit my exact riding position, are adjustable
                for fine-tuning, and look way cooler than off-the-shelf options. Plus, I wanted to prove that
                with modern CAD tools and 3D printing, custom bike components are totally achievable.
            </p>

            <!-- Problem Statement -->
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Every cyclist is built differently, but most aerobars come in just a few sizes. Finding
                the perfect fit usually means:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spending $500+ on high-end adjustable systems (ouch, my wallet)</li>
                <li>Compromising on fit and dealing with discomfort on long rides</li>
                <li>Buying multiple spacers, extenders, and adapters that add weight and look messy</li>
                <li>Still not getting exactly what you want</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                My bike needed aerobars that would work with my specific geometry, allow for easy adjustments,
                be strong enough to handle the forces during hard efforts, and - let's be honest - look sick.
            </p>

            <!-- Design Process -->
            <h2>Design & Development Process</h2>

            <h3>1. Research & Measurements</h3>
            <p>
                Started by measuring my current riding position and researching bike fit principles. I took
                photos and videos of my position on the bike, measured reach and stack requirements, and
                studied how commercial aerobars are designed. Turns out, there's a lot of biomechanics involved
                in getting this right!
            </p>

            <h3>2. CAD Modeling</h3>
            <p>
                Fired up Fusion 360 and got to work. The design needed to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clamp securely to standard handlebars without damaging them</li>
                <li>Provide adjustable arm pad positioning (because bike fit is never "done")</li>
                <li>Include comfortable grip extensions at the right angle</li>
                <li>Keep the weight reasonable (every gram counts, right?)</li>
                <li>Look sleek and aerodynamic (form follows function, but it should look good too)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I went through probably a dozen iterations, tweaking angles, adjusting lengths, and optimizing
                the internal structure for strength while minimizing material use.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Structural Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Before printing anything, I ran FEA simulations to make sure these wouldn't snap during a hard
                sprint. Modeled realistic loading conditions (body weight + dynamic loads from riding) and
                checked stress concentrations at critical points like the clamp interface and arm pad mounts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first design? Way too flexible. The second? Overbuilt and heavy. Third time's the charm -
                found the sweet spot with internal ribbing that keeps it stiff without adding unnecessary weight.
            </p>

            <!-- Manufacturing -->
            <h2>Manufacturing & Assembly</h2>

            <h3>3D Printing Strategy</h3>
            <p>
                Printed the main components using PETG (tougher than PLA, easier than nylon). Key printing decisions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>100% infill in high-stress areas like clamps and mounting points</li>
                <li>Oriented parts to align layer lines with load directions (strength > aesthetics... but both are nice)</li>
                <li>Printed at 0.2mm layer height for a balance of strength and print time</li>
                <li>Added extra perimeters (walls) for impact resistance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Post-Processing & Assembly</h3>
            <p>
                After printing, I cleaned up the parts, test-fit everything, and made some refinements:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sanded contact surfaces for a smooth finish</li>
                <li>Added rubber padding in the clamp area to protect the handlebars</li>
                <li>Wrapped the arm pads with foam and bar tape for comfort</li>
                <li>Used stainless steel hardware throughout (because rusty bolts on a bike are unacceptable)</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Testing -->
            <h2>Testing & Real-World Performance</h2>

            <h3>Static Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Before trusting these on an actual ride, I clamped them in a vice and loaded them up to simulate
                riding forces. Applied weight gradually while watching for any flex, creaking, or movement. They
                held up great - no slipping, no cracking, solid as a rock.
            </p>

            <h3>On-Bike Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Time for the moment of truth - actually riding with them! Started with short, easy rides to check
                for any issues. Then gradually increased duration and intensity:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ Comfortable on long rides (2+ hours without numbness or discomfort)</li>
                <li>✅ Stable during hard efforts and sprints (no flex or movement)</li>
                <li>✅ Easy adjustability - I've tweaked the position multiple times</li>
                <li>✅ Weight is comparable to mid-range commercial options</li>
                <li>✅ Got compliments from other cyclists asking "what are those?" 😎</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Results -->
            <h2>The Results</h2>
            <p>
                Honestly? I'm stoked with how these turned out!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>💪 Strong enough for real-world use (500+ miles so far, zero issues)</li>
                <li>💰 Total cost: ~$30 in materials vs. $300-500 for commercial equivalents</li>
                <li>🎯 Perfect fit customized exactly to my body dimensions</li>
                <li>⚙️ Fully adjustable for ongoing position refinements</li>
                <li>😎 Unique design that turns heads (and starts conversations)</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                <strong>Best part?</strong> I now have the CAD files, so if I need to make changes or if something
                breaks, I can print new parts in a few hours. Try doing that with commercial aerobars!
            </p>

            <!-- Key Learnings -->
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                This project taught me a ton about product design and manufacturing:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ergonomics matter way more than I thought - small changes make huge differences</li>
                <li>FEA is super useful, but nothing beats real-world testing</li>
                <li>Designing for 3D printing requires different thinking than traditional manufacturing</li>
                <li>Iteration is key - my first design was... not great. That's okay!</li>
                <li>Custom fabrication is incredibly empowering - if you need it, you can build it</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Future Work -->
            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            <p>
                Already thinking about version 2.0:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Experiment with carbon fiber sleeves over 3D printed cores for even better strength-to-weight</li>
                <li>Add cable routing channels for a cleaner look</li>
                <li>Design a quick-release system for easy removal</li>
                <li>Maybe even add integrated lighting mounts?</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                But honestly, these work so well I might just keep riding them as-is. Sometimes v1 is good enough! 🚴
            </p>
