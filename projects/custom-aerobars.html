            <!-- Overview -->
            <h2>What's This All About?</h2>
            <p>
                As both an engineer and a cyclist, I got tired of the one-size-fits-all approach to aerobars.
                Inspired by the one piece bars used by pro triathletes like Magnus Ditlev, I decided to make my own
                as an engineer With CAD skills, a 3D printer, aluminum stock, and access to capable tools, I can
                create a similar solution to those high-end setups for a fraction of the cost.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal: create aerobars that fit my exact riding position, look professional, and perform like
                the custom setups you see at Ironman World Championships. This meant ditching the clunky adjustable
                systems and going for a clean, integrated design - aluminum frame with 3D printed forearm cups,
                mounted directly to the stem. No compromises, just custom.
            </p>

            <!-- Technical Stack/Tools -->

            <!-- Problem Statement -->
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Every cyclist is built differently, but most aerobars are either cheap and uncomfortable or
                crazy expensive. The high-end custom setups that pros use? Those will set you back $1000+
                and require sending your bike to a specialist. The challenge was to replicate that level
                of custom fit and performance without the massive price tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                I needed aerobars that would:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Perfectly match my riding position (no adjustability needed if it's designed right)</li>
                <li>Support my entire forearms comfortably for long-distance riding</li>
                <li>Mount cleanly to my stem for that integrated, pro look</li>
                <li>Be strong enough to handle hard efforts and bumps with minimal flexing</li>
                <li>Look like they belong on the bike, not like a homemade solution</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Design Process -->
            <h2>Design & Development Process</h2>

            <h3>1. Research & Position Mapping</h3>
            <p>
                As a starting point I look and level of polish to match. I also had a position I already found  
                works for me through use of a basic set of aerobars, and a previous version that... didn't meet my 
                standards 😅. But I learned a lot from it! 
            </p>

            <h3>2. CAD Modeling - The Hybrid Approach</h3>
            <p>
                Fired up Onshape and designed a hybrid system combining the best of both worlds:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aluminum frame:</strong> Main structure for strength and stiffness - this takes all the load</li>
                <li><strong>Stem mount:</strong> Custom aluminum clamp that replaces the standard stem cap, creating a clean integrated look</li>
                <li><strong>3D printed forearm cups:</strong> Ergonomic supports molded exactly to my forearm shape for maximum comfort</li>
                <li><strong>No adjustability:</strong> Everything dimensioned precisely for my position (if it's right the first time, you don't need to adjust)</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Manufacturing -->
            <h2>Fabrication & Assembly</h2>

            <h3>Aluminum Frame & Mount</h3>
            <p>
                The aluminum structural components were fabricated from aluminum stock. The main frame is simple
                but effective - the profile was cut on a waterjet and tapped holes added on a bridgeport.
                The stem mount was a bit more difficult - it was also cut in profile on a waterjet, then some milling,
                drilling, and counterboring made for a drop in replacement for the existing stem clamp.
            </p>

            <h3>3D Printed Forearm Cups</h3>
            <p>
                The forearm cups were 3D printed in ASA-CF for UV resistance and stiffness. These are shaped to
                cradle my entire forearms, distributing pressure evenly instead of just having small pads like
                traditional aerobars. Key printing decisions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Printed at 0.2mm layer height for smooth surface finish</li>
                <li>Split into 2 parts to fit on a Bambu X1 printer</li>
                <li>just a few perimeters and low infill kept weight down, the shape makes it strong</li>
                <li>Added foam padding on the inside for extra comfort</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Testing -->
            <h2>Testing & Real-World Performance</h2>

            <h3>Static Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Before trusting these on an actual ride, I loaded them up in a bench test to simulate riding forces.
                Put significantly more force than would rotate the bars on basic bar clamp aerobars and the bars felt
                great. A bit of flex that absorbs some impact from bumps, but not enough that if feels concerning.
            </p>

            <h3>On-Bike Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Time for the moment of truth - actually riding with them! Started cautious but quickly gained
                confidence. The difference from my previous attempt was night and day.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ Incredibly comfortable - full forearm support is a game changer on long rides</li>
                <li>✅ Zero flex even during hard efforts and sprints</li>
                <li>✅ Position feels natural and sustainable for hours</li>
                <li>✅ The integrated look is exactly what I was going for</li>
                <li>✅ Got compliments from other cyclists asking where I bought them 😎</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Future Work -->
            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            <p>
                These work perfectly for me, but I'm already thinking about version 3.0 (as I mentioned 
                there was a version 1 that shall not be mentioned further 😅):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design an adjustable version that could work for different riders or positions</li>
                <li>Make it easier to swap between different stem/bike setups</li>
                <li>Try my hand at custom carbon fiber layup</li>
                <li>Do the real engineering (quantify loads, FEA, Bench testing to failure)</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                The beauty of designing your own is that you can iterate forever. But for now, these do exactly
                what I need them to do, and they look great doing it. Mission accomplished! 🚴
