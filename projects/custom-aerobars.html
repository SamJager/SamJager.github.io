            <!-- Overview -->
            <h2>What's This All About?</h2>
            <p>
                As both an engineer and a cyclist, I got tired of the one-size-fits-all approach to aerobars.
                After looking at what the pros use - custom-fabricated aerobars perfectly tailored to their position -
                I thought, why not make my own? With CAD skills, a 3D printer, and some aluminum stock, I could
                replicate those high-end setups for a fraction of the cost.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal: create aerobars that fit my exact riding position, look professional, and perform like
                the custom setups you see at Ironman World Championships. This meant ditching the clunky adjustable
                systems and going for a clean, integrated design - aluminum frame with 3D printed forearm cups,
                mounted directly to the stem. No compromises, just custom.
            </p>

            <!-- Problem Statement -->
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Every cyclist is built differently, but most aerobars are either cheap and uncomfortable or
                crazy expensive. The high-end custom setups that pros use? Those will set you back $1000+
                and require sending your bike to a specialist. The challenge was to replicate that level
                of custom fit and performance without the massive price tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                I needed aerobars that would:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Perfectly match my riding position (no adjustability needed if it's designed right)</li>
                <li>Support my entire forearms comfortably for long-distance riding</li>
                <li>Mount cleanly to my stem for that integrated, pro look</li>
                <li>Be strong enough to handle hard efforts without flexing</li>
                <li>Look like they belong on the bike, not like an aftermarket add-on</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Design Process -->
            <h2>Design & Development Process</h2>

            <h3>1. Research & Position Mapping</h3>
            <p>
                Started by studying how pro triathletes and time trialists set up their positions. Took detailed
                measurements of my optimal aero position - reach, stack, elbow width, forearm angle. I spent
                hours on the bike with tape and cardboard mockups to nail down exactly where my arms needed to be.
                Let's just say there was a previous attempt that... didn't go great. Learned a lot from that one! 😅
            </p>

            <h3>2. CAD Modeling - The Hybrid Approach</h3>
            <p>
                Fired up Fusion 360 and designed a hybrid system combining the best of both worlds:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aluminum frame:</strong> Main structure for strength and stiffness - this takes all the load</li>
                <li><strong>Stem mount:</strong> Custom aluminum clamp that replaces the standard stem cap, creating a clean integrated look</li>
                <li><strong>3D printed forearm cups:</strong> Ergonomic supports molded exactly to my forearm shape for maximum comfort</li>
                <li><strong>No adjustability:</strong> Everything dimensioned precisely for my position (if it's right the first time, you don't need to adjust)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The design went through several iterations. Modeling the forearm cups to provide full support while
                keeping weight down was tricky - had to balance comfort with minimal material. The stem mount needed
                to be bomb-proof since that's the critical structural connection.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Structural Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Before fabricating anything, I ran FEA simulations on the aluminum frame to verify it could handle
                the loads. Modeled worst-case scenarios - full body weight on the forearms during a sprint, hitting
                bumps, lateral forces from handling. The stem mount got extra attention since that's the single
                point of attachment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The beauty of using aluminum for the main structure is that I could design it thin and light while
                still being incredibly stiff. The 3D printed cups don't carry structural loads - they're just there
                for comfort and support.
            </p>

            <!-- Manufacturing -->
            <h2>Fabrication & Assembly</h2>

            <h3>Aluminum Frame & Mount</h3>
            <p>
                The aluminum components were fabricated from 6061-T6 aluminum stock. The main frame is simple
                but effective - straight sections with carefully positioned bends to match my riding geometry.
                The stem mount was the trickiest part - it replaces the standard stem clamp and had to fit
                precisely while maintaining clamping force.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cut and bent aluminum tubing to exact dimensions</li>
                <li>Machined the stem mount interface for perfect fit</li>
                <li>Deburred all edges (aluminum splinters are no joke)</li>
                <li>Anodized black to match the bike aesthetic</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3D Printed Forearm Cups</h3>
            <p>
                The forearm cups were 3D printed in PETG (durable and slightly flexible). These are shaped to
                cradle my entire forearms, distributing pressure evenly instead of just having small pads like
                traditional aerobars. Key printing decisions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Printed at 0.2mm layer height for smooth surface finish</li>
                <li>Used organic supports to maintain the complex curved geometry</li>
                <li>40% infill was plenty - these don't carry structural loads</li>
                <li>Post-processed with acetone vapor for a smoother finish</li>
                <li>Added foam padding on the inside for extra comfort</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Testing -->
            <h2>Testing & Real-World Performance</h2>

            <h3>Static Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Before trusting these on an actual ride, I loaded them up in a bench test to simulate riding forces.
                Put my full body weight on the forearm cups, tested the stem mount under various loads, checked for
                any flex or movement. The aluminum frame is rock solid - zero flex even under hard loads.
            </p>

            <h3>On-Bike Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Time for the moment of truth - actually riding with them! Started cautious but quickly gained
                confidence. The difference from my previous attempt was night and day.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ Incredibly comfortable - full forearm support is a game changer on long rides</li>
                <li>✅ Zero flex even during hard efforts and sprints</li>
                <li>✅ Position feels natural and sustainable for hours</li>
                <li>✅ The integrated look is exactly what I was going for</li>
                <li>✅ Got compliments from other cyclists asking where I bought them 😎</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Results -->
            <h2>The Results</h2>
            <p>
                Honestly? I'm stoked with how these turned out!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>💪 Bomber construction - aluminum frame handles everything I can throw at it</li>
                <li>💰 Total cost: ~$80 in materials vs. $1000+ for pro-level custom setups</li>
                <li>🎯 Perfect fit because it was designed specifically for my body and riding style</li>
                <li>😌 Full forearm support = no numbness or discomfort even on century rides</li>
                <li>😎 Clean, integrated look that rivals professional custom builds</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                <strong>Best part?</strong> They're custom-tailored to me, which means they fit better than any
                off-the-shelf option ever could. That's the power of designing and making your own gear!
            </p>

            <!-- Key Learnings -->
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                This project taught me a ton about product design and manufacturing:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Full forearm support is massively more comfortable than traditional arm pads</li>
                <li>Getting the position right takes time and patience - mockups are your friend</li>
                <li>Hybrid designs (metal + 3D printing) leverage the strengths of both materials</li>
                <li>Sometimes the first version teaches you what NOT to do (that's valuable too!)</li>
                <li>Custom fabrication lets you replicate pro-level equipment on a DIY budget</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Future Work -->
            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            <p>
                These work perfectly for me, but I'm already thinking about version 3.0 (yes, there was a v1
                that shall not be spoken of 😅):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design an adjustable version that could work for different riders or positions</li>
                <li>Make it easier to swap between different stem/bike setups</li>
                <li>Integrate cable routing for electronic shifters</li>
                <li>Maybe offer the design to other cyclists who want custom aerobars without the custom price</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                The beauty of designing your own is that you can iterate forever. But for now, these do exactly
                what I need them to do, and they look great doing it. Mission accomplished! 🚴
